# Internet-Ad-Prediction

Details of assignment brief 
There is ad-dataset.zip file available on moodle in the assessment information section. The 
dataset includes image data with continuous features, binary data for the image and 
whether it is an image for an advert or not.
Your task for this assessment is to analyse the dataset and make sure you can build a model 
for correctly predicting whether an image that you pass on to the model later is an advert or 
not.
The dataset contains the phrases in the URL, the alt text etc. There are two class labels “ad”
and “nonad” to indicate whether an image is an advert or not an advert respectively. 
For the model you should also be providing a report on your discoveries, test this against
more than one model and see how the results change and explain why different algorithms
have different results
